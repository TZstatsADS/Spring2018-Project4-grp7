# Memory-Based Algorithm

## Load Organized Data

We have already organized data before
```{r}
# You can check code in 'movie_organize.Rmd' in lib
# movie_train <- read.csv("../data/movie_train.csv")
# movie_test <- read.csv("../data/movie_test.csv")

```


## Calculate similarity weights 

Pearson Correlation & Vector Similarity & SimRank
```{r}

# Movie

# You can check code in 'pearson_vector.Rmd' in lib
# load("../output/weight/movie_train_pearson.RData")
# load("../output/weight/movie_train_vector.RData")

 
# MS

# You can check code in 'pearson_vector.Rmd' in lib
# load("../output/weight/ms_train_pearson.RData")
# load("../output/weight/ms_train_vector.RData")


```


## Select neighborhood and Prediction
```{r}
# Movie

# #movie_pearson_threshold
# neighborhood <- weight_thre(movie_train_pearson)
# movie_pearson_threshold <- movie_predict(similarity = movie_train_pearson)

# #movie_vector_threshold
# neighborhood <- weight_thre(movie_train_vector)

# save(movie_vector_threshold,file = "movie_vector_threshold.RData")
# #movie_simrank_threshold
# neighborhood <- weight_thre(movie_train_simrank)
# movie_simrank_threshold <- movie_predict(train = movie_train[1:100,-1],
#                                     test = movie_test[1:100,-1],
#                                     similarity = movie_train_simrank)

#                                     similarity = movie_train_simrank)
# save(movie_simrank_bestn,file = "movie_simrank_bestn.RData")
# 
# #movie_pearson_comb
# neighborhood <- weight_comb(movie_train_pearson)
# movie_pearson_comb <- movie_predict(similarity = movie_train_pearson)
# save(movie_pearson_comb,file = "movie_pearson_comb.RData")
# #movie_vector_comb

# movie_vector_comb <- movie_predict(similarity = movie_train_vector)
# save(movie_vector_comb,file = "movie_vector_comb.RData")

#                                     test = movie_test[1:100,-1],

# save(movie_simrank_comb,file = "movie_simrank_comb.RData")
