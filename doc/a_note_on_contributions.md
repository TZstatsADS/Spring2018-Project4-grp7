### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

+ Memory-based Algorithm:
     + Ding, Xueying: Process the Movie-data into matrix that can be used to calculate the similarity; Write function to gain pearson correlation and vector similarity and apply it on MS-data and Movie-data; Write fucntion to select neighbor and apply it on Movie-data; Write function to predict and apply it on movie data.   
     + Fan, Xiaochen: Process the MS-data into matrix that can be used to calculate the similarity; Predict the MS-data and calculate the ranking score of each combination; Write the SimRank function of Moive _data.   
     + Jiang, Chenfei: Write the SimRank function of Movie data. Write the MAE and ROC function to evaluate the performance of different methods.
